# KitsuneDiscord

A Python Instagram username scraper. Originally created by 4201337, updated to run on Python 3 by me, ported as a Discord bot by /u/exofeel.

**These instructions are for Windows and should work on macOS as well. Linux instructions may come in the future.**

1. Download this project as a .zip
2. Unzip to a directory of your choice
3. Install requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Get bot token from Discord
5. Replace bot.run with your token
6. `cd` to the directory you installed Kitsune to
7. run `python3 KitsuneDiscord.py`

If done correctly, KitsuneDiscord will instantly search Instagram for the username you provide it.

When a user gets banned or deactivates their account, the username they had will still show up as available, but will not be able to be set as a username.

Batch .txt support coming soon.
