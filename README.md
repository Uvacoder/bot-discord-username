# KitsuneDiscord

A social media username scraper made for use as a Discord bot.

**Installation on Windows and macOS**
--------------

1. Download this project as a .zip
2. Unzip to a directory of your choice
3. Install requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Get bot token from Discord
5. Replace bot.run with your token
6. `cd` to the directory you installed Kitsune to
7. run `python KitsuneDiscord.py`

**Usage**
--------------

KitsuneDiscord's default prefix is `%`. The correct syntax is `%kitsune (social media) (username)`

If done correctly, KitsuneDiscord will instantly check if the provided username is taken.

On certain social medias, for example, Instagram, if a user gets banned or deactivates their account, the username they had will still show up as available, but will not be able to be set as a username.

Batch .txt support coming soon.
